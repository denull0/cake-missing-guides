# Cake's Missing Guide
I decided to start this repo after experiencing some issues with my Osa. Everyone is welcome to contribute. Always contact Cake's support if you have problems with your bike.

# Cake Osa
### Fenders are banging against the wheel.
Sometimes when riding on uneven surfaces the plastic fender would flex and bang on the wheel. The solution from Cake is to cut 5cm from the fender.

### Rattling noise from the motor.
Take a video and contact their support. But you can check to make sure you have the correct belt tension (25-30mm). If this doesn't help, check if the front sprocket is properly tightened, before jumping to terminal conclusions. 

### How to see % of battery remaining?
Hold the middle and bottom buttons for 5 seconds and you'll see the Info screen. Look for "SoC".

### Issues with unscrewing a screw
Cake is using Loctite 243, so it's best if you bring the bike to a proper mechanic that has better tools and skills than you.

### Osa+ Battery autonomy with a passenger?
Adding around 120kg of weight (passenger + rider) and riding in Portugal (warm climate + hilly roads) can squeeze around 50-60km of autonomy on Mode 2. 

### Cleaning the white seats and grips?
I used normal kitchen cleaning liquids and it worked. The grips are trickier to clean because of the texture.

### Can I add the bluetooth module if my Osa doesn't have it?
Nope. But a quick solution is getting a GPS tracker like [Invoxia](https://www.invoxia.com/en-GB). The design fits the Osa nicely, and you don't have to figure out how to hide it. It charges via USB Mini so you can use Osa's battery to charge it.
